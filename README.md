# Railway Cargo Loading Volume Analysis and Forecasting
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`railway_logistics.ipynb`) that analyzes and forecasts the volume of cargo loading for a railway system. The notebook uses Python libraries such as `pandas`, `plotly`, `numpy`, and `statsmodels` for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.

## Overview
The project focuses on analyzing historical cargo loading data and forecasting future volumes to optimize profits for different loading stations. The key steps include data preparation, visualization, forecasting, and profit calculation.

## Key Features
- **Data Preparation**: The data is loaded from an Excel file and transformed from a wide format to a long format for easier time series analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive visualizations are created to understand trends and patterns in cargo loading volumes.
- **Forecasting**: Time series forecasting techniques are used to predict future cargo loading volumes for the period from January 1, 2024, to March 1, 2024.
- **Profit Calculation**: The notebook calculates the total profit for each loading station and the profit per shipment, considering variable costs per kilometer.
- **Station Selection**: Based on the profit calculations, the most profitable loading station is selected and justified.

## Data
The data is loaded from an Excel file (`input_data.xlsx`).
